As you may have noticed, there are two python files, webcam.py, and webcam_cv3.py. Webcam.py may not work as of today, with python 3.8.2. However I still included it. Webcam_cv3
utilizes OpenCV3 and I know for sure works. It will put a green box around any face detected. This is not 100% fool proof. It will sometimes detect things that aren't faces, but I
try my best to fix it.
